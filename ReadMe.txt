In order to run the program, you need node installed.
Running RunMe.bat will call npm install, start the server, and open the browser to the webpage.

If this does not work, try running from your documents folder / the working directory of the unzipped folder.

Suggested browser is Google Chrome.

If elements of the visualization are overlapping, switch to a higher resolution / make the webpage full-screen as this was developed in 4k.
